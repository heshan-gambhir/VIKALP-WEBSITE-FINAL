			<h3>>>Overview of Our Idea</h3>
			<p>Our game intends to educate the masses about the teachings of important preachers of history while also having fun. It promotes important life skills essential to a person so that a person may lead the life he/she wants. The most fundamental part of decision making is simply making good and right choices. Our game fosters this very principle while still sticking to the definition of a game which increases the attention span of an individual and inevitably makes him/her understand and learn the good teachings that are scattered plenty in the game. It also stands with the Prime Minister of India’s campaign to make a “Digital India”.

		<h3>>>Our Approach towards Idea Development?</h3>
		<p>We reached the conclusion of creating a story based choice making game after thorough discussion. 
				We believe that a story format will be more interactive and gripping, thus making the game more effective in reaching out to students from different parts of India.
				This format of telling a story to promote learning is not new but coming from the times of gurukuls and is a proven method of teaching. This boils down to the conclusion that one is at best when they are happy and positive and stories take you to another world where negativity has no power of influ	</div>

			<h3>>>How Our Game Is Different From Existing Games?</h3>
			<p>Our game is different and unique from other existing games in numerous ways. One such attribute we can categorise is the format of the game. It is certainly not a new format but the storyline and idea behind this project certainly is our own. Our main agenda behind this is to provide the player the knowledge in an interactive way so that one doesn’t feel or think he/she is learning. This has been the agenda for a lot of games that are currently existing but we believe that if a player would be able to relate it to his/her real life it would become more engrossing and the player may use the teachings in reality. Nowadays we are so close to  technology that we tend to grasp things faster through such mediums. So, we believe that students will be able to learn and acquire knowledge which the teachings convey in a quicker way. It is rightly said that we learn from experiences and mistakes and keeping this in mind, if any individual plays our game then he/she will be able to make choices in the real world easily because we have already stimulated such a choice in our game and provided insight so as to support the fact why we made that decision. When playing a game we become so engrossed that we tend to forget about how much time has elapsed, which gives us more time to 
				think about situations or events that could be taking place in the future.This is what makes our game stand out from others.

			<h3>>>TEAM BRAHMAND</h3>
			<P> 
We are an enthusiastic quintet currently in 9th grade and studying at Prudence School Dwarka - 22 and are extremely passionate about creating ideas, implementing them, and achieving success. We, youngsters, came together to create this wonderful team that does dreams, creates, and succeeds. 
Our synergies come together as we complement each other and it is because of the seamless workflow we have, we are able to fabricate what we have in our minds into reality. We although have different goals in life, come to the same conclusion that we have to work hard to achieve what we want to and it is this fire inside us that drives us as we strive to be the best, not for one day but for the whole remainder of our lives.
At the core of our team is pure and unfiltered friendship. It is our friendship and love for each other that keeps us together and allows us to understand each other in the flick of an eye.
